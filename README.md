In this assignment, students are tasked with creating a program using any programming language (such as C++, Python, etc.) that simulates geometric transformations to perform single operations like translation, rotation, scaling, and shear, or combined transformation operations such as translation followed by rotation on a 2D shape.

The shape is created by defining a set of corner points and then constructing the shape from these points, which will be arranged in matrix form within the system. The shape created can be a basic shape like a square, circle, etc., or a dynamic irregular shape. However, it would be better to combine both, i.e., basic shapes and dynamic shapes.

Ultimately, the submitted program should have the format 'file.EXE' and should be able to run on any computer with different libraries from the creator.
